# Description
This is the Comet of Dreams website.  The site is built off of Django (Python) and React.js (JavaScript).  So far only has a blog to keep fans updated over time.

Will use Heroku for web hosting and Google Domains for Domain Registration.

# Server Features implementing - With Django
1. Admin Dashboard (CMS) - For tracking music releases, media images/ sound/ video - import Django CMS plugin
2. CRM (Admin Dashboard) - interaction tracking, lead management, email manager, reporting and analytics, todo list for COD, etc.
3. eCommerce Store - Sell digital downloads and other merchandise

# Client Features implementing
- HTML5 - Look, including iframe tags for streaming links
- CSS3 - Styling
- React.js - Interactivity and look
- Bootstrap - Most likely for styling
- Howler.js - Maybe for streaming music links.

A dependency for this project on the server side is Django.

Using pipenv as the virtual environment, Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are in the Root folder

Running on http://localhost:8000 off of pipenv for Django development

# Todos:
1. Do a lot of the server end for everything (at least to get started)
2. Figure out basic template layout
3. Apply React to interact with the client

# Server todos:
1. Figure out a way to only have an admin delete blog posts and not others.

# Client todos:
1. Be able to look at each individual blog post.
